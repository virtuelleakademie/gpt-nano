title: "GPT is Not An Oracle"
---



## Workshop Description

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly human-like in their performance, it is important to develop effective ways to describe their behaviour using high-level concepts, without falling into the trap of anthropomorphism.

In this workshop, we will investigate how LLMs are trained, how they produce text, and what they are capable of. Importantly, we will address what LLMs are not capable of, and how to use them correctly. We will also discuss similarities and differences between LLMs and human thought processes.

Specifically, we will address the way that people seem to want to use ChatGPT as an oracle, whose goal is to provide truthful statements. We will discuss why is not the case, and how to use LLMs correctly.
